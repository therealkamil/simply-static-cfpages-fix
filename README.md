# simply-static-cfpages-fix

If you find your canonical URLs are ending up as only ```<link href=/ rel=canonical>``` and your sitemaps end up as only ```<loc>/</loc>``` then use this!

Instructions:

1. Export the .zip from Static WP with the default relative path settings
2. Then replace example.com with your own domain (keep in mind www or non www) in the script.
3. Run the script and it will ask for your current zip and create a new zip of your choice with an amended canonical and correct sitemaps.
4. Upload the new .zip to Cloudflare Pages.
5. Bob's Your Uncle =)
